# React State Exercise - Magic Eightball

## Description  

In this exercise, students create a small React app to practice working with `React.useState()`. The goal is to simulate the Magic Eightball toy. We begin with a default state. When we click on the Eightball, the state will change and display a randomized answer from a pool of possible answers. There is also a button to revert the Eightball back to it's default state. The focus is on controlling the state of a single component.

## Getting Started  

*The app is initialized with `create-react-app`. As this exercise is completed during the ReactJS Fundamentals unit, and students (like myself) are just beginning to learn React, there will surely be unnecessary files included in the repository.*  

1. Clone the repository into a directory with the name of your choice: `git clone https://github.com/SeanBailey15/react_state_exercise.git <your_directory_name>`
2. Navigate into the newly created directory: `cd <your_directory_name>`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the command: `npm start` in the terminal
5. Get that nostalgic feeling (IYKYK)

For this project in particular, that is all that needs to be done. What follows in this README are default scripts that come standard with a basic React app when initialized with `create-react-app`, as well as links to learn more. There are no tests written for this exercise, so `npm test` (and the rest of the default scripts, for that matter) should be ignored in this case.  

## Thanks for checking out my solution! Have fun!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
